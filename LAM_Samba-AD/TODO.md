## üìù Notes

### Working Configuration (Reference)
```bash
loginMethod: "list"
attr_user: "#sAMAccountName;#givenName;#sn;#mail"
Admins: "CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=haver,DC=internal"
DN case: UPPERCASE CN/DC
Config structure: typeSettings
```

### Key Learnings
1. Always validate against source code, not just documentation
2. LAM 9.3 only has "list" and "search" loginMethods (no "fixed")
3. attr_user must only use attributes that exist in Samba AD schema
4. Admins field must be string (semicolon-separated), not array
5. DN case matters - use UPPERCASE CN/DC for consistency
