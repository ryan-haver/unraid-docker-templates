# Deployment Methods Comparison

## Three Ways to Deploy Samba AD + LAM

### 🏆 Option 1: GitHub Container Registry (RECOMMENDED)

**Setup Complexity**: ⭐ (Easiest)
**Cost**: FREE forever
**Secrets Required**: 0

```bash
# One-time setup
1. Create GitHub repo (public)
2. git push
3. Done!

# Users pull with:
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/samba-ad-lam:latest
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero secrets configuration
- ✅ Free unlimited storage
- ✅ Free unlimited bandwidth
- ✅ Built-in GitHub authentication
- ✅ Native GitHub integration
- ✅ No separate accounts needed
- ✅ Auto-builds on every push

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Repository must be public for free hosting
- ⚠️ Less known than Docker Hub (but growing)

**See**: `GITHUB-NO-DOCKERHUB.md`

---

### Option 2: Docker Hub (Alternative)

**Setup Complexity**: ⭐⭐ (Medium)
**Cost**: FREE (with limits)
**Secrets Required**: 2 (DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD)

```bash
# One-time setup
1. Create Docker Hub account
2. Create GitHub repo
3. Add Docker Hub secrets to GitHub
4. git push

# Users pull with:
docker pull yourusername/samba-ad-lam:latest
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ More widely known
- ✅ Well-established platform
- ✅ Good documentation
- ✅ Auto-builds on every push

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires separate Docker Hub account
- ⚠️ Requires secrets configuration
- ⚠️ Free tier has pull rate limits
- ⚠️ Free tier has storage limits

**See**: `GITHUB-SETUP.md`

---

### Option 3: Manual Local Build (For Development)

**Setup Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Most work)
**Cost**: FREE
**Secrets Required**: 0

```bash
# Every time you need the image:
1. Clone repo
2. Build locally
3. Push to registry (optional)

# Build command:
docker build -t samba-ad-lam .
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over build process
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Good for testing/development
- ✅ No accounts needed

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Users must build themselves
- ⚠️ Slow (no caching between users)
- ⚠️ Requires Docker build environment
- ⚠️ No automatic updates
- ⚠️ Manual version management

**See**: `build.sh`

| **Free Storage** | Unlimited | 500MB | N/A |
| **Free Bandwidth** | Unlimited | Limited | N/A |
| **Auto-builds** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Multi-arch** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Version Control** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Public/Private** | Both | Both | N/A |
| **Build Cache** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Local only |
| **Best For** | Production | Production | Development |

## Recommendation by Use Case

### For This Project (Samba AD + LAM)
**👉 Use: GitHub Container Registry (Option 1)**

**Why?**
- Zero configuration complexity
- No secrets to manage
- Free unlimited hosting
- Perfect for open-source projects
- Users don't need Docker Hub accounts

### For Private Enterprise Projects
**👉 Use: GitHub Container Registry with Private Repos**
- Built-in GitHub authentication
- Integrated with enterprise GitHub
- Granular access control

### For Maximum Visibility
**👉 Use: Docker Hub (Option 2)**
- More discoverable on Docker Hub
- Larger existing user base
- Better for public image discovery

### For Development/Testing
**👉 Use: Manual Build (Option 3)**
- Quick iteration
- No registry overhead
- Full local control

---

## Migration Path

### Already Using Docker Hub? No Problem!

You can **support both** registries simultaneously:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/docker-build.yml
# Push to both registries
- name: Push to Docker Hub
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    push: true
    tags: yourusername/samba-ad-lam:latest

- name: Push to GitHub Container Registry
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    push: true
    tags: ghcr.io/yourusername/samba-ad-lam:latest
```

Then users can choose:
```bash
# From Docker Hub
docker pull yourusername/samba-ad-lam:latest

# OR from GitHub
docker pull ghcr.io/yourusername/samba-ad-lam:latest
```

---

## Our Choice: GitHub Container Registry

**This project is configured for GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) because:**

1. ✅ **Zero friction**: No secrets, no separate accounts
2. ✅ **Free forever**: No storage or bandwidth limits
3. ✅ **Integrated**: Lives alongside code in GitHub
4. ✅ **Simple**: Users just need GitHub (they probably already have it)
5. ✅ **Modern**: Built-in support for multi-arch, OCI standards

**You can change this anytime** by editing `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`

## Getting Started

**Ready to deploy?**

👉 See `GITHUB-NO-DOCKERHUB.md` for setup (3 minutes!)

**Want Docker Hub instead?**

👉 See `GITHUB-SETUP.md` for Docker Hub setup (5 minutes)

**Just want to test locally?**

👉 Run `./build.sh` (10 minutes first build)

---

**Recommended**: Start with GitHub Container Registry. It's the simplest and you can always add Docker Hub later if needed! 🚀
