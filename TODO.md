## 🎓 Learning & Knowledge Sharing

### Internal Knowledge Base

**Key Learnings from This Project:**

1. **OAuth Flow Complexity:** Web-based OAuth is significantly easier than terminal-based
2. **Multi-LLM Support:** Abstraction layer (LLMFactory) makes provider switching seamless
3. **Reverse Proxy Challenges:** Automatic detection works better than manual configuration
4. **Documentation ROI:** Comprehensive docs save weeks of support time
5. **Separate Containers:** Much easier to maintain than monolithic approach

**Reusable Patterns:**

- **Dual-Port Architecture:** Separate setup UI from main service (ports 2024/2025)
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Runtime config updates (configure-proxy.sh pattern)
- **Zero-Config Defaults:** Everything works without configuration, allows advanced customization
- **State Management:** Simple file-based state tracking (setup_state.json)
- **CORS Handling:** Environment variable to JSON array conversion

**Template for Future Projects:**

```
1. Plan thoroughly (1-2 weeks documentation)
2. Build core functionality first
3. Add UI/UX polish second
4. Documentation throughout
5. Community feedback integration
6. Iterate based on real usage
```
