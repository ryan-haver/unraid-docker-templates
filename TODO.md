# Unraid Docker Templates - Development TODO & Roadmap

**Project:** Multi-Service Unraid Template Repository  
**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025  
**Current Focus:** üî¥ **CRITICAL: Authentication Implementation Required**  
**Status:** üî¥ Security Alert - Both UIs Unprotected

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Comprehensive Security Review Completed (October 30, 2025)**  
> **Document:** [AGENT-INBOX-STORAGE-AND-AUTH-ROADMAP.md](LangChain/AGENT-INBOX-STORAGE-AND-AUTH-ROADMAP.md) (573 lines)
>
> **üî¥ CRITICAL FINDINGS**:
> - ‚ùå **NO AUTHENTICATION** on any UI (ports 2024, 2025, 3000)
> - ‚ùå **OAuth tokens accessible** to anyone on network (`/app/secrets`)
> - ‚ùå **LangSmith API keys exposed** without password protection
> - ‚ùå **Full email access** - anyone can read/send as authenticated user
> - ‚ùå **No audit logging** - cannot track who accessed what
>
> **ÔøΩ CRITICAL UX PROBLEMS** (Discovered during testing):
> - ‚ùå **Draft responses lost** on page reload - users lose typed work
> - ‚ùå **Filter selection resets** every page load - annoying reconfiguration
> - ‚ùå **Inbox order not customizable** - cannot organize multiple inboxes
> - ‚ùå **Scroll position lost** between sessions - poor UX
>
> **üìã IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**:
> 1. **Phase 4A** (3-5 days) - Fix UX issues FIRST - users losing work is unacceptable
> 2. **Phase 4B** (2-3 weeks) - Add authentication - security critical but no data loss
> 3. **Phase 5** (2-3 weeks) - Enhanced features - polish and power user tools
> 4. **Phase 6** (4-5 weeks) - Multi-user RBAC - for team/enterprise use
>
> **üéØ RATIONALE FOR PRIORITY**:
> - UX fixes prevent **permanent data loss** (typed drafts)
> - Authentication prevents **unauthorized access** (serious but no data loss from app itself)
> - Both are critical, but losing user work is more immediate/frustrating
> - UX fixes take days, auth takes weeks - quick wins first

## üöÄ Feature Roadmap

### üî¥ URGENT - Agent Inbox: Critical UX & Storage Fixes (Phase 4A)

**Priority**: URGENT (3-5 days, COMPLETE FIRST)  
**Context**: Show-stopper UX issues discovered during testing. Users lose work, must reconfigure preferences on every page load. Must fix BEFORE authentication to avoid rework.

**Critical Problems**:
1. **Draft responses lost on page reload** - User types response, refreshes page, work gone
2. **Filter selection resets** - User selects "All", refreshes, back to "Interrupted"
3. **Inbox order not customizable** - Users with many inboxes cannot organize them
4. **Scroll position resets** - User scrolls down thread list, refreshes, back to top
5. **No notification preferences** - When implemented, needs to persist

#### Day 1-2: Draft Auto-Save (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Add `drafts` to PersistentConfig interface
  ```typescript
  drafts?: {
    [threadId: string]: {
      content: string;
      lastSaved: string;
      threadStatus?: string; // For context
    };
  };
  ```
- [ ] Create `useDraftStorage` hook
  - Auto-save every 5 seconds when user is typing
  - Debounced save to avoid excessive writes
  - Load draft on thread view mount
- [ ] Add draft indicator to UI
  - Show "Draft saved at HH:MM" below textarea
  - "Discard Draft" button
  - Warning before navigating away with unsaved draft
- [ ] Sync drafts to server storage
  - Add to localStorage AND server config
  - Preserve across devices
- [ ] Test scenarios:
  - Type response, refresh page ‚Üí Draft restored ‚úÖ
  - Type response, switch threads ‚Üí Draft saved ‚úÖ
  - Type response, close browser ‚Üí Draft persists ‚úÖ

#### Day 2-3: Filter Preference Persistence
- [ ] Add `lastSelectedFilter` to preferences object
  ```typescript
  preferences: {
    theme?: string;
    defaultInbox?: string;
    lastSelectedFilter?: ThreadStatusWithAll; // NEW
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update `index.tsx` to read from config
  - Change: `useState("interrupted")` 
  - To: `useState(config.preferences?.lastSelectedFilter || "interrupted")`
- [ ] Save filter selection on change
  - Call `updateConfig({ preferences: { ...preferences, lastSelectedFilter } })`
  - Sync to server storage
- [ ] Test: Select "All", refresh ‚Üí Still on "All" ‚úÖ

#### Day 3: Inbox Ordering
- [ ] Add `inboxOrder` to preferences
  ```typescript
  preferences: {
    ...existing,
    inboxOrder?: string[]; // Array of inbox IDs in desired order
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop in inbox sidebar
  - Use react-beautiful-dnd or similar
  - Reorder inboxes array on drop
  - Save order to preferences
- [ ] Apply ordering when rendering inbox list
  - Sort config.inboxes by preferences.inboxOrder
  - Fall back to creation order if no preference set

#### Day 4: Notification Preferences (Prep for future)
- [ ] Add notification structure to preferences
  ```typescript
  preferences: {
    ...existing,
    notifications?: {
      enabled: boolean;
      sound: boolean;
      desktop: boolean;
      emailOnInterrupt?: boolean; // Future
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create settings UI section for notifications
  - Toggle switches for each option
  - Save to preferences on change
  - Sync to server storage
- [ ] Document in README for future implementation

#### Day 5: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Integration testing all new features
  - Draft auto-save across page reloads
  - Filter persistence across sessions
  - Inbox ordering across devices
  - All features work with server storage enabled
  - All features work in browser-only mode
- [ ] Update Unraid template documentation
- [ ] Git commit and tag

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ No user work lost on page reload
- ‚úÖ UI state persists across sessions
- ‚úÖ Multi-device sync works for all preferences
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (works without server storage)
- ‚úÖ Performance: Auto-save doesn't lag typing

## üîß Technical Debt & Code Quality

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Agent Inbox Bug Fixes

**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL BUGS FIXED (October 30, 2025)

**Recently Fixed**:
- ‚úÖ **Bug #1**: Welcome dialog race condition (wait for `isLoading`)
  - Issue: Dialog appeared even with pre-configured inboxes
  - Fix: Check `isLoading` before evaluating `config.inboxes.length`
  - Commit: [hash from git log]
  
- ‚úÖ **Bug #2**: Inbox not visible in sidebar after creation
  - Issue: useInboxes hook not integrated with persistent config
  - Fix: Load from `config.inboxes` when `serverEnabled=true`
  - Commit: [hash from git log]
  
- ‚úÖ **Bug #3**: Duplicate inbox creation (server creates two configs)
  - Issue: Server and UI both creating config.json
  - Fix: Server creates immediately, UI doesn't merge
  - Commit: 2f2ab20
  
- ‚úÖ **Bug #4**: Add inbox via UI not persisting
  - Issue: `updateConfig()` has 1-second debounced save, page reloaded too early
  - Fix: Direct `fetch('/api/config')` with await before reload
  - Commit: 84c0fd6
  - Container: agent-inbox:add-inbox-fix-v2
  - User Validation: "i was able to add an inbox...or two :)" ‚úÖ

**Persistent Storage Implementation**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure (API, file storage, Docker volume)
- Phase 2: UI Integration (React hooks, sync, fallback)
- Phase 3: Zero-Touch Deployment (pre-configuration via env vars)
- **Documentation**: See [AGENT-INBOX-STORAGE-AND-AUTH-ROADMAP.md](LangChain/AGENT-INBOX-STORAGE-AND-AUTH-ROADMAP.md) for complete feature matrix and technical architecture

**What Works Now**:

## üéì Learning & Knowledge Sharing

### Internal Knowledge Base

**Key Learnings from This Project:**

1. **OAuth Flow Complexity:** Web-based OAuth is significantly easier than terminal-based
2. **Multi-LLM Support:** Abstraction layer (LLMFactory) makes provider switching seamless
3. **Reverse Proxy Challenges:** Automatic detection works better than manual configuration
4. **Documentation ROI:** Comprehensive docs save weeks of support time
5. **Separate Containers:** Much easier to maintain than monolithic approach

**Reusable Patterns:**

- **Dual-Port Architecture:** Separate setup UI from main service (ports 2024/2025)
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Runtime config updates (configure-proxy.sh pattern)
- **Zero-Config Defaults:** Everything works without configuration, allows advanced customization
- **State Management:** Simple file-based state tracking (setup_state.json)
- **CORS Handling:** Environment variable to JSON array conversion

**Template for Future Projects:**

```
1. Plan thoroughly (1-2 weeks documentation)
2. Build core functionality first
3. Add UI/UX polish second
4. Documentation throughout
5. Community feedback integration
6. Iterate based on real usage
```
