## 🎓 Key Insights Across All Documents

### Pattern Reuse (From Storage Implementation)
```
✅ Feature flag pattern (USE_SERVER_STORAGE → AUTH_ENABLED)
✅ API route structure (/api/config → /api/auth/*)
✅ React hook pattern (usePersistentConfig → useAuth)
✅ Backend service layer (config-storage.ts → auth-service.ts)
✅ Error handling (graceful fallback)
✅ Backward compatibility (disabled by default)
```

### What's New (Not in Storage)
```
❌ Password hashing (bcrypt)
❌ Session management (cookies + tokens)
❌ Route protection (middleware)
❌ Login UI page
❌ Security validation (not just input validation)
❌ Generic error messages (prevent enumeration)
```

### Critical Security Requirements
```
🔒 bcrypt with ≥12 rounds
🔒 HTTP-only cookies (prevent XSS)
🔒 SameSite=strict (prevent CSRF)
🔒 30-minute session timeout
🔒 Never log passwords/tokens
🔒 Generic error messages
🔒 Secure flag in production
```

## 🚀 Getting Started Right Now

### Step 1: Generate Password Hash (2 minutes)
```bash
cd agent-inbox
npm install bcryptjs
node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); console.log(bcrypt.hashSync('YourPassword123!', 12));"
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables (1 minute)
```bash
# Edit .env.local
AUTH_ENABLED=true
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=<paste output from Step 1>
```

### Step 3: Open Checklist (Now!)
```bash
# Open DAY-BY-DAY-CHECKLIST.md
# Start with Day 1: Password Hashing Utility
```

### Step 4: Code for 1 hour
```bash
# Create lib/security/password-hash.ts
# Follow Day 1 instructions
# Test with provided commands
# Commit with provided message
```

### Step 5: Repeat Daily
```bash
# Each day:
# 1. Open DAY-BY-DAY-CHECKLIST.md
# 2. Find current day
# 3. Follow tasks with checkboxes
# 4. Test after each task
# 5. Commit with provided message
# 6. Move to next day
```
